<!--
  Hi Jazmine, your first webpage submission is really good! The only error is that you don't have a link to it from the home page.
  On Friday, we wrote <a> tags on the home page to link to this webpage submission. In the future, you will do this with all webpage submissions.

  Also, this is very minor, but the second comment on this page was intended to demonstrate that you could even put other code inside a comment and the browsers would ignore it.
  Try putting a whole set of <p></p> tags around the text inside your comment and see that the markup is ignored.

    <h2>head</h2>
    <p>This is a container for information not displayed on the page.</p>
    <h3>title</h3>
    <p>This always lives in the head and is necessary for a valid HTML5 page.</p>
