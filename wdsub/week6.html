    <h2>Cross Country</h2>
    <p>Cross country equestrian jumping forms one of the three phases of the sport of eventing; it may also be a competition in its own right, known as hunter trials or simply "cross-country", although these tend to be lower-level, local competitions.
</p>
    <p>The object of cross-country is to prove the speed, endurance and jumping ability of the true cross-country horse when it is well trained and brought to the peak of condition. At the same time, it demonstrates the rider's knowledge of pace and the use of this horse across country. (While cross-country tests a horse's endurance over a short period, endurance itself is a separate sport, involving long-distance cross-country riding without jumps).</p>

    <h2>Dressage</h2>
    <p>Dressage is a form of horse riding performed in exhibition and competition, as well as an art sometimes pursued solely for the sake of mastery. As an equestrian sport defined by the International Equestrian Federation, dressage is described as "the highest expression of horse training" where "horse and rider are expected to perform from memory a series of predetermined movements".</p>
    <p>Competitions are held at all levels from amateur to the Olympic Games and World Equestrian Games. Its fundamental purpose is to develop, through standardized progressive training methods, a horse's natural athletic ability and willingness to perform, thereby maximizing its potential as a riding horse. At the peak of a dressage horse's gymnastic development, the horse responds smoothly to a skilled rider's minimal aids. The rider is relaxed and appears effort-free while the horse willingly performs the requested movement.</p>
    <p>In modern dressage competition, successful training at the various levels is demonstrated through the performance of "tests", prescribed series of movements ridden within a standard arena. Judges evaluate each movement on the basis of a standard appropriate to the level of the test and assign each movement a score from zero to ten – zero being "not executed" and 10 being "excellent". A competitor achieving all 6s (or 60% overall) might typically then move up to the next level.</p>

    <h2>Hunter Jumping</h2>
    <p>The hunter discipline aims to assess all the skills required in the sport of foxhunting, where horse and rider navigate rough terrain with obstacles such as fences and hedges. In the arena, jumps are meant to test the horse’s manners, movement, and jumping form. Hunter obstacles are made to simulate the natural obstacles fox hunters would encounter, featuring wood, greenery, and flowers.</p>
    <p>In hunter classes, horses are judged based on elegance, athleticism, and style. To do this, they evaluate performance by the horse’s temperament, cadence, movement, form over jumps, conformation, and turnout. Because form is more important than agility in hunters, the fence heights do not go up as high as those in the jumper discipline.</p>
    <p>Typically, a hunter course features between eight and 12 straightforward jumps, designed to display rather than test the horse and rider’s skills. Judges score different criteria from 1-10, and if multiple judges are scoring one class, all judges’ scores are then averaged and converted into a score out of 100. Faults in hunter classes can range from major violations like falls, refusals, or hitting or knocking down fences to minor violations such as pace adjustments or poor jumping form. Judges may also penalize signs of poor attitude from the horse, such as ear pinning.</p>

    <h2>Show Jumping</h2>
    <p>Show jumping is a part of a group of English riding equestrian events that also includes eventing, hunters, and equitation. Jumping classes are commonly seen at horse shows throughout the world, including the Olympics. Sometimes shows are limited exclusively to jumpers. Sometimes jumper classes are offered in conjunction with other English-style events. Sometimes, show jumping is but one division of a very large, all-breed competition that includes a very wide variety of disciplines. Jumping classes may be governed by various national horse show sanctioning organizations, such as the United States Equestrian Federation or the British Showjumping Association. International competitions are governed by the rules of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports.</p>
    <p>Jumper classes are scored objectively, based entirely on a numerical score determined only by whether the horse attempts the obstacle, clears it, and finishes the course in the allotted time. Jumper courses tend to be much more complex and technical than hunter courses because riders and horses are not being judged on style. Courses often are colorful and at times, quite creatively designed. Jumper courses can range anywhere in height from 0.80 meters to 1.60 meters.</p>
