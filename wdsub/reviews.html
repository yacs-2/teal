  <h2 class="heading">The Hobbit</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.compassbookratings.com/the-hobbit/#google_vignette" target="_blank">The Hobbit</a> is a wonderful story because it has almost the perfect dose of every story element. The overall plot is <strong>straightforward</strong> but filled with many <strong>sub-adventures</strong>. Although the beginning is a bit slow, especially for younger readers, as soon as the adventure truly begins (about 40 pages in) the story moves quickly.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">Animal Farm</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://greenishbookshelf.com/2024/09/21/animal-farm-a-review/" target="_blank">Animal Farm</a> is an incredible classic! The storytelling is simple yet profound. The characters are complex and surprising. And the overall message is powerful yet concerning. A truly thought provoking classic!

  <h2 class="heading">Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</h2>
  <p><a href="https://theinvisiblementor.com/booked-on-tuesdays-review-%E2%80%93-narrative-of-the-life-of-frederick-douglass/" target="_blank">Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</a> is a book worth reading. It's not for finger-pointing, but to understand what life was like for blacks before the abolition of slavery. It also shows how people sometimes use religion as a scapegoat to dehumanize and control others.</p>
